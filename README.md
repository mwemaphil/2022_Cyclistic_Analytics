### Analysis done by Philip Mwema

- **Cyclistic**, a bike-share company cinsisting of 5,824 bicycles and 692 docking stations in Chicago, USA. Cyclistic offers traditional bikes,  reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes making the bike-share more inclusive to everybody including people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day. 

* The purpose of this analysis is comparing how causal members and annual paying subscribers differ.
* Data of the last 12 months was downloaded from [Cyclistic’s historical trip data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html), for the last 12 months, that is from January 2022 to December 2022.

* Data was compiled from 12 different months, that is from Jan 2022 to Dec 2022 and merged into one using pandas for easier assessmnet and analysis. Initial assessment, both visually and programmatic were done and some issues were found after which some clean-up was done using pandas to acquire a clean dataset for visualization.

* Simple visualaztion was done to answer some basic questions but the cleaned data was exported to Tableu where finer visualization was done.
